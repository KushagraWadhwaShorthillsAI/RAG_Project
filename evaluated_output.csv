Abstract
This document is an introductory tutorial to using regular expressions in Python
with theremodule.  It provides a gentler introduction than the
corresponding section in the Library Reference.
Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially
a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made
available through theremodule. Using this little language, you specify
the rules for the set of possible strings...","The `keyword` module enables a Python program to check if a string is a keyword or soft keyword.

","Chunk 1: Added in version 3.7.
The Python Development Mode introduces additional runtime checks that are too
expensive to be enabled by default. It should not be more verbose than the
default if the code is correct; new warnings are only emitted when an issue is
detected.
It can be enabled using the-Xdevcommand line option or by
setting thePYTHONDEVMODEenvironment variable to1.

Enabling the Python Development Mode is similar to the following command, but

Chunk 2: Source code:Lib/warnings.py
Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert
the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesn’t
warrant raising an exception and terminating the program.  For example, one
might want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module.
Python programmers issue warnings by calling thewarn()function defined
in this module.  (C programmers usePyErr_WarnEx(); seeException Handlingfor details).

Chunk 3: Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.  Creating
a new class creates a newtypeof object, allowing newinstancesof that
type to be made.  Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for
maintaining its state.  Class instances can also have methods (defined by its
class) for modifying its state.
Compared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes
with a minimum of new syntax and semantics.  It is a mixture of the class
mechanisms...","The `__future__` mechanism in Python allows the use of new features in modules before those features become standard.

The MRO constructs a linearization of a class, listing its ancestors from nearest to furthest.  For single inheritance, this is straightforward; however, with multiple inheritance, the process is more complex, ensuring that the order respects local precedence and monotonicity.  Python 2.3 and later versions use the C3 linearization algorithm to compute the MRO, which prioritizes preserving order whenever possible.  If an order cannot be preserved, an exception is raised, preventing ambiguous hierarchies.  The MRO determines the resolution order for attributes as well as methods.

Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert
the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesn’t
warrant raising an exception and terminating the program.  For example, one
might want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module.
Python programmers issue warnings by calling thewarn()function defined
in this module.  (C programmers usePyErr_WarnEx(); seeException Handlingfor details).

For more on interactive mode, seeInteractive Mode.
By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.  In that
encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously
in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library
only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code
should follow.  To display all these characters properly, your editor must
recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it...
Chunk 2:  properly, your editor must
recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the
characters in the file.
To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line
should be added as thefirstline of the file.  The syntax is as follows:

For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first

This avoids intermediate copying and offers performance benefits.  The protocol's consumer side provides ways to obtain a pointer to the raw data, while the producer side exports a buffer interface describing the buffer's structure.  Buffers are not `PyObject` pointers but simple C structures, facilitating easy creation and copying.  A `memoryview` object can serve as a generic wrapper.  The buffer's logical structure (shape, strides, suboffsets) can vary, and consumers use flags to specify the buffer type they can handle.  Non-contiguous arrays are possible, where the pointer may not point to the memory block's beginning.  Functions like `PyObject_GetBuffer()` and `PyBuffer_Release()` are crucial for managing buffer access and preventing resource leaks.

Context:

The Python interpreter has two variants of the interactive shell. The classic basic interpreter is supported on all platforms with minimal line control capabilities. On Windows, or Unix-like systems with curses support, a new interactive shell is used by default. This one supports color, multiline editing, history browsing, and paste mode. To disable color, see Controlling color for details. Function keys provide some additional functionality. F1 enters the interactive help browser pydoc. F2 allows for browsing the command-line history with neither output nor the '>' and '...' prompts. F3 enters ""paste mode"", which makes pasting larger blocks of code easier. Press F3 to return to the normal mode. When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing the stack trace. Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit status; this applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output. Typing the interrupt character (usually Control-C or Delete) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the primary prompt. Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises the KeyboardInterrupt exception, which may be handled by an except clause in a try statement. On BSD'ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the line ""#!/usr/bin/env python"" (assuming that the interpreter is on the user's $PATH) at the beginning.

Context:

The Python interpreter has two variants of the interactive shell. The classic basic interpreter is supported on all platforms with minimal line control capabilities. On Windows, or Unix-like systems with curses support, a new interactive shell is used by default. This one supports color, multiline editing, history browsing, and paste mode. To disable color, see Controlling color for details. Function keys provide some additional functionality. F1 enters the interactive help browser pydoc. F2 allows for browsing the command-line history with neither output nor the '>' and '...' prompts. F3 enters ""paste mode"", which makes pasting larger blocks of code easier. Press F3 to return to the normal mode. When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing the stack trace. Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit status; this applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output. Typing the interrupt character (usually Control-C or Delete) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the primary prompt. Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises the KeyboardInterrupt exception, which may be handled by an except clause in a try statement. On BSD'ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the line ""#!/usr/bin/env python"" (assuming that the interpreter is on the user's $PATH) at the beginning.

Some modules are built into the interpreter, providing access to operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in for efficiency or to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls.  The set of such modules is a configuration option which also depends on the underlying platform.  For example, the winreg module is only provided on Windows systems.  One particular module deserves some attention: sys, which is built into every Python interpreter.  The variables sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 define the strings used as primary and secondary prompts: these two variables are only defined if the interpreter is in interactive mode.  The variable sys.path is a list of strings that determines the interpreter’s search path for modules.  It is initialized to a default path taken from the environment variable PYTHONPATH, or from a built-in default if PYTHONPATH is not set.  You can modify it using standard list operations:

Question: What determines the interpreter's search path for modules in Python?
","Chunk 1: A module search path is initialized when Python starts. This module search path
may be accessed atsys.path.
The first entry in the module search path is the directory that contains the
input script, if there is one. Otherwise, the first entry is the current
directory, which is the case when executing the interactive shell, a-ccommand, or-mmodule.
ThePYTHONPATHenvironment variable is often used to add directories
to the search path. If this environment variable is found then the contents are
adde...

The MRO constructs a linearization of a class, listing its ancestors from nearest to furthest.  For single inheritance, this is straightforward; however, with multiple inheritance, the process is more complex, ensuring that the order respects local precedence and monotonicity.  Python 2.3 and later versions use the C3 linearization algorithm to achieve this.  This algorithm merges the linearizations of parent classes and the list of parents to determine the MRO, prioritizing more specialized classes.  If an unambiguous ordering cannot be determined, Python raises an exception.  The MRO applies to attributes as well as methods.

similar to global variables, but they offer a more usefulrepr(),
grouping, type-safety, and a few other features.

Or perhaps the RGB primary colors:

This list respects local precedence ordering and monotonicity, ensuring that if class C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of C, then C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of any subclass of C.  Classic classes maintain their old method resolution order, which is depth-first and then left-to-right.  The MRO determines the resolution order of attributes, not just methods.

Abstract
This document is an introductory tutorial to using regular expressions in Python
with theremodule.  It provides a gentler introduction than the
corresponding section in the Library Reference.
Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially
a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made
available through theremodule. Using this little language, you specify
the rules for the set of possible strings...

languages like Rust or Haskell. Only the first pattern that matches
gets executed and it can also extract components (sequence elements
or object attributes) from the value into variables.
The simplest form compares a subject value against one or more literals:
Note the last block: the “variable name”_acts as awildcardand
never fails to match. If no case matches, none of the branches is executed.
You can combine several literals in a single pattern using|(“o...

By default, arguments may be passed to a Python function either by position

"File objects in Python can be easily written to and read from strings. Numbers take a bit more effort, since the read() method only returns strings, which will have to be passed to a function like int(), which takes a string like '123' and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists and dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated. Rather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to files, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The standard module called json can take Python data hierarchies and convert them to string representations; this process is called serializing. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called deserializing. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored in a file or database, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine.

The name is a string that identifies the function. The code object is a compiled

Traditionally, state belonging to Python extension modules was kept in Cstaticvariables, which have process-wide scope. This document
describes problems of such per-process state and shows a safer way:
per-module state.
The document also describes how to switch to per-module state where
possible. This transition involves allocating space for that state, potentially
switching from static types to heap types, and—perhaps most
importantly—accessing per-module state from code.

Otherwise, it searches for directories containing standard Python modules and extension modules, using the Python executable's location as a starting point and looking for specific landmark files and directories.

"The text file mode is 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, and 'a' for appending.
In addition, two special modes are available: 'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing.
The '+' sign should not be used with 'w' or 'a' mode.
It is good practice to use 'b' after the mode letter to open the file in binary mode, as this will ensure that the file is read and written in binary mode, regardless of the platform.

Python lists have a built-inlist.sort()method that modifies the list

sorted list from an iterable.

"File positioning functions now return the new absolute position instead ofNone.

Text file positioning functions
-------------------------------

File positioning functions allow you to manipulate the current file position of a file object.

### seek(whence=0, offset=0)

The seek() method changes the file position to the given byte offset, and returns the new absolute position.

The whence argument is optional and defaults to 0 (os.SEEK\_SET), which means the offset is relative to the beginning of the file.

The whence argument can also be os.SEEK\_CUR (1) or os.SEEK\_END (2), which means the offset is relative to the current position or the end of the file, respectively.

### tell()

The tell() method returns the current file position, as an integer.

### truncate([size])

The truncate() method resizes the map and the underlying file, if any.

If the size argument is present, the file is truncated to that size. If the size argument is absent, the file is truncated to the current position.

Resizing a map created with ACCESS\_READ or ACCESS\_COPY will raise a TypeError exception.

Resizing a map created with trackfdset to False will raise a ValueError exception.

On Windows, resizing the map will raise an OSError if there are other maps against the same named file. Resizing an anonymous map (ie against the page file) will silently create a new map with the original data copied over up to the length of the new size.

### fstat()

The fstat() method returns the status of the file as a stat\_result object.

### fileno()

The fileno() method returns the integer number of the file descriptor.

### isatty()

The isatty() method returns True if the file is a tty device.

### read(size=-1)

The read() method reads up to size bytes from the file and returns them, as a bytes object.

If size is negative or omitted, the entire file will be read and returned.

### readline(size=-1)

The readline() method reads a single line, starting at the current file position and up to the next newline. The line is returned as a bytes object.

If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.

The file position is updated to point after the bytes that were read.

### readlines(hint=-1)

The readlines() method reads until the end of the file line by line and returns them as a list of bytes objects.

If hint is specified, at most hint bytes will be read.

### write(bytes)

The write() method writes the bytes in bytes into memory at the current position of the file pointer and returns the number of bytes written (never less than len(bytes), since if the write fails, a ValueError will be raised).

The file position is updated to point after the bytes that were written.

If the mmap was created with ACCESS\_READ, then a TypeError will be raised.

### writelines(lines)

The writelines() method writes the lines in lines into memory at the current position of the file pointer and returns the number of bytes written (never less than the sum of the length of the lines, since if the write fails, a ValueError will be raised).

The file position is updated to point after the bytes that were written.

If the mmap was created with ACCESS\_READ, then a TypeError will be raised.

A Python distribution includes a `Makefile` and a `pyconfig.h` header file used for building the Python binary and third-party C extensions.  `sysconfig` stores variables from these files in a dictionary accessible via `get_config_vars()` or `get_config_var()`.  Installation schemes vary by platform and options;  `sysconfig` uses unique identifiers based on `os.name` to store these schemes.  These schemes determine where files are copied during installation.  Nine schemes are supported: `posix_prefix`, `posix_home`, `posix_user`, `posix_venv`, `nt`, `nt_user`, `nt_venv`, `venv`, and `osx_framework_user`.  Each scheme comprises eight paths: `stdlib`, `platstdlib`, `platlib`, `purelib`, `include`, `platinclude`, `scripts`, and `data`.

Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert
the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesn’t
warrant raising an exception and terminating the program.  For example, one
might want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module.
Python programmers issue warnings by calling thewarn()function defined
in this module.  (C programmers usePyErr_WarnEx(); seeException Handlingfor details).

Text:

    The curses library is a terminal control library that allows you to write text-based user interfaces.  It provides a number of functions for manipulating the screen, including creating and updating windows, reading input, and controlling the cursor.

    To use the curses library, you first need to initialize the screen by calling initscr().  This function initializes the screen and returns a screen object, which you can use to create and manipulate windows.

    Once you have a screen object, you can create new windows by calling newwin().  This function takes the number of lines and columns you want the window to have, as well as the coordinates of the top-left corner of the window, and returns a new window object.

    You can write strings to the current window using the addstr() function.  This function takes a string as an argument and writes it to the current window.

    After you have written to a window, you can update the physical screen to match the virtual screen by calling outrefresh() or doupdate().  The normal way to update the screen is to call outrefresh() followed by doupdate().  If you have multiple windows that you want to update, you can improve performance and reduce screen flicker by calling outrefresh() on all of the windows, followed by a single doupdate().

    The curses library also provides a number of functions for controlling the cursor.  For example, you can use the filter() function to disable certain capabilities of the terminal, such as the ability to move the cursor.  You can also use the flash() function to flash the screen, which can be useful for getting the user's attention.

    To read input from the user, you can use the getch() function.  This function waits for the user to press a key and then returns the corresponding character code.  If the user presses a special key, such as a function key or an arrow key, getch() will return a special character code that you can use to identify the key that was pressed.

    The curses library also provides support for mouse input.  To use this feature, you need to call the getmouse() function after the user has pressed a mouse button.  This function retrieves the queued mouse event and returns it as a 5-tuple containing the ID of the device, the x and y coordinates of the event, and the state of the mouse buttons.

A Python distribution includes a `Makefile` and a `pyconfig.h` header file used for building the Python binary and third-party C extensions.  `sysconfig` stores variables from these files in a dictionary accessible via `get_config_vars()` or `get_config_var()`.  Installation schemes vary by platform and options;  `sysconfig` uses unique identifiers based on `os.name` to store these schemes.  These schemes determine where files are copied during installation.  Nine schemes are supported: `posix_prefix`, `posix_home`, `posix_user`, `posix_venv`, `nt`, `nt_user`, `nt_venv`, `venv`, and `osx_framework_user`.  Each scheme comprises eight paths: `stdlib`, `platstdlib`, `platlib`, `purelib`, `include`, `platinclude`, `scripts`, and `data`.  The `get_path()` function, using variables from `get_config_vars()`, expands paths;  `get_paths()` returns a dictionary of installation paths for a given scheme.  `get_platform()` returns a string identifying the current platform, useful for distinguishing platform-specific build directories and distributions.

recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the

difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or

Provides functionality to topologically sort a graph ofhashablenodes.
A topological order is a linear ordering of the vertices in a graph such that
for every directed edge u -> v from vertex u to vertex v, vertex u comes
before vertex v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may
represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that
one task must be performed before another; in this example, a topological
ordering is just a val...","This question cannot be answered from the given source.  The provided text mentions a feature ""Added in version 3.9"", but does not contain information about version 3.1.
