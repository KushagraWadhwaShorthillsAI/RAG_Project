The MRO constructs a linearization of a class, listing its ancestors from nearest to furthest.  For single inheritance, this is straightforward; however, with multiple inheritance, the process is more complex, ensuring that the order respects local precedence and monotonicity.  Python 2.3 and later versions use the C3 linearization algorithm to compute the MRO, which prioritizes preserving order whenever possible.  If an order cannot be preserved, an exception is raised, preventing ambiguous hierarchies.  The MRO determines the resolution order for attributes as well as methods.

"Context: Perhaps one of the most important structures of the Python object system is the structure that defines a new type: the PyTypeObject structure. Type objects can be handled using any of the PyObject_* or PyType_* functions, but do not offer much that’s interesting to most Python applications. These objects are fundamental to how Python objects behave, so they are very important to the interpreter itself and to any extension module that implements new types.

Type objects are fairly large compared to most of the standard types. The reason for the size is that each type object stores a large number of values, mostly C function pointers, each of which implements a small part of the type’s functionality.

the name of the top-level environment of the program, which can be
checked using the__name__=='__main__'expression; and
the__main__.pyfile in Python packages.
Both of these mechanisms are related to Python modules; how users interact with
them and how they interact with each other.  They are explained in detail
below.  If you’re new to Python modules, see the tutorial sectionModulesfor an introduction.

selection of values.  For example, the days of the week:

Buffers are not `PyObject` pointers but simple C structures, facilitating easy creation and copying.  A `memoryview` object can serve as a generic wrapper.  The buffer's logical structure (shape, strides, suboffsets) can vary, and consumers use flags to specify the buffer type they can handle.  Non-contiguous arrays are possible, where the pointer may not point to the memory block's beginning.

programs.  It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single stepping at
the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source code listing, and

The Python Development Mode introduces additional runtime checks that are too
expensive to be enabled by default. It should not be more verbose than the
default if the code is correct; new warnings are only emitted when an issue is

Chunk 3: These libraries help you with Python development: the debugger enables you to

provide visibility into runtime behaviors that would otherwise require
intrusive debugging or patching....","The provided text does not explain how to make the debugger stop at a built-in level.  It describes how to set breakpoints at specific lines of code or within functions, but not specifically how to target built-in functions.

Context:

The Python interpreter has two variants of the interactive shell. The classic basic interpreter is supported on all platforms with minimal line control capabilities. On Windows, or Unix-like systems with curses support, a new interactive shell is used by default. This one supports color, multiline editing, history browsing, and paste mode. To disable color, see Controlling color for details. Function keys provide some additional functionality. F1 enters the interactive help browser pydoc. F2 allows for browsing the command-line history with neither output nor the '>' and '...' prompts. F3 enters ""paste mode"", which makes pasting larger blocks of code easier. Press F3 to return to the normal mode. When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing the stack trace. Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit status; this applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output. Typing the interrupt character (usually Control-C or Delete) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the primary prompt. Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises the KeyboardInterrupt exception, which may be handled by an except clause in a try statement. On BSD'ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the line ""#!/usr/bin/env python"" (assuming that the interpreter is on the user's $PATH) at the beginning.

Context:

The Python interpreter has two variants of the interactive shell. The classic basic interpreter is supported on all platforms with minimal line control capabilities. On Windows, or Unix-like systems with curses support, a new interactive shell is used by default. This one supports color, multiline editing, history browsing, and paste mode. To disable color, see Controlling color for details. Function keys provide some additional functionality. F1 enters the interactive help browser pydoc. F2 allows for browsing the command-line history with neither output nor the '>' and '...' prompts. F3 enters ""paste mode"", which makes pasting larger blocks of code easier. Press F3 to return to the normal mode. When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing the stack trace. Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit status; this applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output. Typing the interrupt character (usually Control-C or Delete) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the primary prompt. Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises the KeyboardInterrupt exception, which may be handled by an except clause in a try statement. On BSD'ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the line ""#!/usr/bin/env python"" (assuming that the interpreter is on the user's $PATH) at the beginning.

"Context:
Python comes with a library of standard modules, described in the Python Library Reference.  Some modules are built into the interpreter, providing access to operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in for efficiency or to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls.  The set of such modules is a configuration option which also depends on the underlying platform.  For example, the winreg module is only provided on Windows systems.  One particular module deserves some attention: sys, which is built into every Python interpreter.  The variables sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 define the strings used as primary and secondary prompts: these two variables are only defined if the interpreter is in interactive mode.  The variable sys.path is a list of strings that determines the interpreter’s search path for modules.  It is initialized to a default path taken from the environment variable PYTHONPATH, or from a built-in default if PYTHONPATH is not set.  You can modify it using standard list operations:

Question: What determines the interpreter's search path for modules in Python?
","Chunk 1: A module search path is initialized when Python starts. This module search path
may be accessed atsys.path.
The first entry in the module search path is the directory that contains the
input script, if there is one. Otherwise, the first entry is the current
directory, which is the case when executing the interactive shell, a-ccommand, or-mmodule.

The MRO constructs a linearization of a class, listing its ancestors from nearest to furthest.  For single inheritance, this is straightforward; however, with multiple inheritance, the process is more complex, ensuring that the order respects local precedence and monotonicity.  Python 2.3 and later versions use the C3 linearization algorithm to achieve this.  This algorithm merges the linearizations of parent classes and the list of parents to determine the MRO, prioritizing more specialized classes.  If an unambiguous ordering cannot be determined, Python raises an exception.  The MRO applies to attributes as well as methods.

Theforstatement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used
to in C or Pascal.  Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression
of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the
iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’sforstatement
iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that
they appear in the sequence.  For example (no pun intended):

Sockets are used nearly everywhere, but are one of the most severely

For new-style classes (introduced in Python 2.2), the C3 linearization algorithm is used to create a class precedence list, which orders ancestors from nearest to furthest.  This list respects local precedence ordering and monotonicity, ensuring that if class C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of C, then C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of any subclass of C.  Classic classes maintain their old method resolution order, which is depth-first and then left-to-right.  The MRO determines the resolution order of attributes, not just methods.

"File objects in Python can be easily written to and read from strings. Numbers take a bit more effort, since the read() method only returns strings, which will have to be passed to a function like int(), which takes a string like '123' and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists and dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated. Rather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to files, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The standard module called json can take Python data hierarchies and convert them to string representations; this process is called serializing. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called deserializing. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored in a file or database, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine.

Question: What is the standard module used for serializing Python data hierarchies to string representations?
","Chunk 1: The modules described in this chapter support storing Python data in a
persistent form on disk.  Thepickleandmarshalmodules can turn

User-defined functions have the following parts:

- A global namespace

The name is a string that identifies the function. The code object is a compiled

A function object is created by a function definition. The only operation on a

User-defined functions have the following parts:
- A name
- A code object
- A closure (a tuple of cells used to implement free variables)
- A global namespace

The name is a string that identifies the function. The code object is a compiled
version of the function's source code. The closure is used to implement free
variables in the function. The global namespace is the dictionary that contains
the global variables used in the function.

Built-in functions are functions that are built into the Python interpreter.
Examples of built-in functions include len(), max(), and min(). These functions
are always available and do not have a name, code object, closure, or global
namespace.

To create a user-defined function, you can use the def statement. Here is an
example:

def greet(name):
print(f""Hello, {name}!"")

In this example, greet is the name of the function, and name is the parameter
passed to the function. The code inside the function is indented to indicate

Chunk 3: Abstract
Traditionally, state belonging to Python extension modules was kept in Cstaticvariables, which have process-wide scope. This document
describes problems of such per-process state and shows a safer way:
per-module state.
The document also describes how to switch to per-module state where
possible. This transition involves allocating space for that state, potentially
switching from static types to heap types, and—perhaps most
importantly—accessing per-module state from code.
This guide is...","To make a Python application archive directly executable on POSIX systems, specify the interpreter to use.  For distribution, ensure the interpreter is portable.

The whence argument is optional and defaults to 0 (os.SEEK\_SET), which means the offset is relative to the beginning of the file.

The whence argument can also be os.SEEK\_CUR (1) or os.SEEK\_END (2), which means the offset is relative to the current position or the end of the file, respectively.

### tell()

The tell() method returns the current file position, as an integer.

### truncate([size])

The truncate() method resizes the map and the underlying file, if any.

If the size argument is present, the file is truncated to that size. If the size argument is absent, the file is truncated to the current position.

Resizing a map created with ACCESS\_READ or ACCESS\_COPY will raise a TypeError exception.

Resizing a map created with trackfdset to False will raise a ValueError exception.

On Windows, resizing the map will raise an OSError if there are other maps against the same named file. Resizing an anonymous map (ie against the page file) will silently create a new map with the original data copied over up to the length of the new size.

### fstat()

The fstat() method returns the status of the file as a stat\_result object.

### fileno()

The fileno() method returns the integer number of the file descriptor.

### isatty()

The isatty() method returns True if the file is a tty device.

### read(size=-1)

The read() method reads up to size bytes from the file and returns them, as a bytes object.

If size is negative or omitted, the entire file will be read and returned.

### readline(size=-1)

The readline() method reads a single line, starting at the current file position and up to the next newline. The line is returned as a bytes object.

If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.

The file position is updated to point after the bytes that were read.

### readlines(hint=-1)

The readlines() method reads until the end of the file line by line and returns them as a list of bytes objects.

If hint is specified, at most hint bytes will be read.

### write(bytes)

The write() method writes the bytes in bytes into memory at the current position of the file pointer and returns the number of bytes written (never less than len(bytes), since if the write fails, a ValueError will be raised).

The file position is updated to point after the bytes that were written.

If the mmap was created with ACCESS\_READ, then a TypeError will be raised.

### writelines(lines)

The writelines() method writes the lines in lines into memory at the current position of the file pointer and returns the number of bytes written (never less than the sum of the length of the lines, since if the write fails, a ValueError will be raised).

The file position is updated to point after the bytes that were written.

If the mmap was created with ACCESS\_READ, then a TypeError will be raised.

User-defined functions have the following parts:
- A name
- A code object
- A closure (a tuple of cells used to implement free variables)
- A global namespace

The name is a string that identifies the function. The code object is a compiled

Built-in functions are functions that are built into the Python interpreter.

To create a user-defined function, you can use the def statement. Here is an
example:

A topological order is a linear ordering of the vertices in a graph such that

Text:

    The curses library is a terminal control library that allows you to write text-based user interfaces.  It provides a number of functions for manipulating the screen, including creating and updating windows, reading input, and controlling the cursor.

    To use the curses library, you first need to initialize the screen by calling initscr().  This function initializes the screen and returns a screen object, which you can use to create and manipulate windows.

    Once you have a screen object, you can create new windows by calling newwin().  This function takes the number of lines and columns you want the window to have, as well as the coordinates of the top-left corner of the window, and returns a new window object.

    You can write strings to the current window using the addstr() function.  This function takes a string as an argument and writes it to the current window.

    After you have written to a window, you can update the physical screen to match the virtual screen by calling outrefresh() or doupdate().  The normal way to update the screen is to call outrefresh() followed by doupdate().  If you have multiple windows that you want to update, you can improve performance and reduce screen flicker by calling outrefresh() on all of the windows, followed by a single doupdate().

    The curses library also provides a number of functions for controlling the cursor.  For example, you can use the filter() function to disable certain capabilities of the terminal, such as the ability to move the cursor.  You can also use the flash() function to flash the screen, which can be useful for getting the user's attention.

    To read input from the user, you can use the getch() function.  This function waits for the user to press a key and then returns the corresponding character code.  If the user presses a special key, such as a function key or an arrow key, getch() will return a special character code that you can use to identify the key that was pressed.

    The curses library also provides support for mouse input.  To use this feature, you need to call the getmouse() function after the user has pressed a mouse button.  This function retrieves the queued mouse event and returns it as a 5-tuple containing the ID of the device, the x and y coordinates of the event, and the state of the mouse buttons.
